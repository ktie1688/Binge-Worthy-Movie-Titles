# Binge-Worthy-Movie-Titles
## Context
In the age of streaming, viewers have access to thousands of movies and TV shows, making the search for the next binge-worthy show an exhausting task. Recommender systems can eliminate that search by using algorithms to filter through those titles and return a list of recommendations based on a viewer's preferences. 
## Objective
Use content and demographic filtering to recommend movie titles based on a show the viewer just watched.
